- for lattice calculations, I would say that it is possible to obtain some limited structural information about fusion products.  the point is that P&R only construct approximations to L_0, hence they can only conjecture eigenvalues and Jordan blocks, not determine structure involving other modes (SVs or beta).  However, Saleur's group have approximations to other Vir modes and they have been able to measure beta from the lattice, see arXiv:1103.3134.

- the outline in the introduction should be much more detailed.  it should extend for at least a page, ie each subsection should be motivated and discussed.  but you can leave this until then end once you've finalised the content and order of all the subsections etc...






- Verma picture needs tidying up + caption!

- for characters, you probably want module which are not quotients of Vermas as well... why restrict yourself?

- given application to modular stuff shortly, why not put the -c/24 factor in the def of character?  And give an example (Vermas)!

- 1.3 sentence motivating CVAs?  alg structure relevant to CFT is not Lie (super)alg, but rather CV(S)As.

- Def. 1.3.1:  Axiom 2 should have D, not L_{-1}, for transation?

- Ex 1.3.1:  V is (generically) the quotient of the h=0 Verma module V_{0,c} by the submodule generated by the SV L_{-1} |0>.  this gives the _universal_ Vir CVA.  when c=c(p,q) is a min mod central charge, the universal CVA is not simple.

- note that axiom 3 suggests a product of fields!  for the TT OPE, you should state that this is an example and maybe refer to the axioms you are using?

- 1.4 mentions superVir and G(z), whoops.  Also, I think you need to have the VOA reps section first!  that's where primary fields belong. the calculation of the fusion rule is nice.  you could conclude by stating the general fusion rules for minimal models.

- 1.5 VOA or CVA ???  need to be consistent or state at the start that you'll use both (but confusing).

- you haven't defined what it means to be a VOA rep???  seems a bit like it's missing given the axiomatics thus far.

- note that all Vir VOA-mods are automatically Vir-mods.  conversely, all (hw) Vir-mods are mods for the universal Vir VOA, but not necessarily for the minimal model VOA.  I feel that you should mention the idea of a minimal model before doing the c=-22/5 calculation.

- 1.5 uses "null vectors" instead of "singular vectors"...

- "We are interested in relaxing..." new paragraph, expand a little? then, we don't get the constraint h=0,-1/5 and so we don't get the minimal model.  ---> logarithmic minimal model (for reasons to be explained later).

- 1.6 need some explanation.  maybe combine with the c=-22/5 calculation?

- you very briefly introduced characters earlier.  why not have a subsection or two on min model characters and S-transforms and Verlinde here?  example (2,5) or (3,4) to compare with min mod fusion?

- then log CFT = non-minimal... does all this still work?
